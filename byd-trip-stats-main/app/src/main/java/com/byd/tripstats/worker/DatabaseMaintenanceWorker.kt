/**
 * Runs once per week in the background to perform **lossless** database
 * compaction only:
 *
 *  1. Checkpoint the WAL file so the main .db is fully self-consistent
 *  2. VACUUM the database to reclaim space freed by deleted trips / manual trims
 *
 * Data-point thinning is deliberately NOT done here. Thinning permanently deletes
 * telemetry samples, so it is left entirely to the user via the manual "Trim
 * database" action (DatabaseTrimmer). This job never destroys data — it only
 * compacts what is already there.
 *
 * The worker is registered as a unique periodic job ("db_maintenance") by
 * BydStatsApplication on first launch. Using KEEP policy means a second
 * registration (e.g. after an app update) leaves the existing schedule intact.
 *
 * Why silent / no user interaction:
 *   Checkpoint + VACUUM are purely mechanical compaction steps — the user has no
 *   meaningful choice to make, and they never alter trip data.
