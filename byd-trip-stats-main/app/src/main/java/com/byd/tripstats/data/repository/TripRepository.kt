     * dashboard show "Waiting for Trip..." for ~1.5 km after starting a new drive.
     *
     * Now: only update the `offStateDurationMs` column. [TripEntity.duration]'s getter
     * subtracts it on read, so every UI surface that reads `trip.duration` (Trip Detail,
     * exports, comparisons, sort) gets the corrected value automatically. The History
     * list's avg-speed column reads from [TripStatsEntity.avgSpeed] and will continue
     * to show the legacy wallclock-based value until the trip is opened (or stats are
     * manually rebuilt) — acceptable trade-off for a non-blocking app start.
     *
     * Also yields between iterations so a concurrent trip insert isn't starved if the
     * DB happens to be busy.
